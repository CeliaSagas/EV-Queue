Revenue & Wait Time Analysis for EV Charging Stations in Palo Alto, CA


**Data**

Data was collected from the [Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofpaloalto.org/home) for the city of Palo Alto, California. [Electric Vehicle Charging Station Data](https://data.cityofpaloalto.org/dataviews/257812/ELECT-VEHIC-CHARG-STATI-83602/) was collected from 8 publicly owned Electric Vehicle Stations comprised of 59 individual plugs for Electric Vehicle charging over the course of 9 years, from July 2011 - December 2020.


**Preparation**

The following transformations were performed on the data in order to support further analysis:

  - Time windows were generated for both Start Time and End Time of each transaction in 2 hour increments
  - Python time delta data was converted to an integer representing hours
  - Individual plug ID's were generated by combining the Address, Station Name, and Port Number. Number of plugs was verified by consumer reports on Plugshare.com
  - kWh revenue per transaction was generated by multiplying kWh per transaction by the kWh rate as posted on the Palo Alto Charging Stations website
  - Parking revenue was generated by subtracting kWh revenue from total revenue per transaction


**Visualizations for All Stations:**

![Number of Transactions by Time Window for All Stations](https://github.com/CeliaSagas/EV-Queue/blob/66e64a81f41efb59c3fc9e36ea6a7e398dc73a96/img/numbertransallstations.jpg)

The busiest time for all stations is the early morning between the hours of 6 AM and 12 PM, represented by an increase in the number of transactions during those time windows.

**Visualizations for Individual Station**

Therefore, revenue per time window will be investigated on a per station basis. 445 Bryant St. was chosen as it has the most number of plugs (12).

The most amount of revenue is generated at the busiest time of day, between the hours of 8 am and 12 pm, when almost 40% of the available plugs are used by consumers.

However, when looking at revenue per transaction, the most lucrative transactions occur overnight, between the hours of 10 PM - 2 AM.

![Duration by Percent](https://github.com/CeliaSagas/EV-Queue/blob/66e64a81f41efb59c3fc9e36ea6a7e398dc73a96/img/durationbypercent.jpg)

When looking at the average duration time of transactions, the busiest time of day, between 10 AM - 12 PM, also represents the shortest transaction times (2.25 hrs or less)


**Next Steps:**

  - Generate individual station df's for all stations
  - Model variable pricing, incentivizing overnight parking
  - Create a tableau dashboard to visualize changes in pricing strategies easily
  - Project an increase in transactions over time, and generate wait times for the increase in traffic based on current patterns.
